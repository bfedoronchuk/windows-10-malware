***************************
For this tutorial, you need to install pywin32. Select the correct release based on your machine's architecture and Python interpreter's version (3.7 is recommended).
pywin32 pip support is experimental. if you had any problem installing it via pip, use this download link (official repository):
https://github.com/mhammond/pywin32/releases

You also need pyHook package that can be downloaded from this link (not sure if it's official, but it works):
www.ifd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#pyhook
let's say your Python version is 3.7 and you're running a 64 bit windows. So you must download pyHook-1.5.1-cp37-cp37m-win_amd64.whl
the open a command line, cd to the download directory and type:
pip install pyHook-1.5.1-cp37-cp37m-win_amd64.whl

if tkinter is not installed, for python3: 
$ sudo apt install python3-tk
on windows it's installed with python
